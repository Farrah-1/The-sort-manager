# Sort Manager Project
Sorts added:
- Binary Tree Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort

This project entailed 3 sort algorithms which the user is able to pick out what sorter they instead to use, the size of the array, which then it will print out the unsorted and sorted arrays. 
Along with the sorted/unsorted arrays, the time taken to run the sort algorithm is also given to the user.
